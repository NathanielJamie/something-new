      <h2>Apple Devices Through the Years</h2>
      <p>
        The story of Apple devices is a journey through innovation, design, and technology. It all began in 1976 with the Apple I, a computer hand-built in a garage, laying the foundation for a company that would go on to change the world. Over the decades, Apple has consistently focused on clean design, intuitive user interfaces, and pushing the boundaries of what personal technology can do.

        In 1984, the original Macintosh revolutionized personal computing with its graphical user interface and mouse, making computers accessible to everyday users. The 1990s brought the Power Macintosh series and the introduction of Mac OS, solidifying Apple’s presence in creative and professional markets. Despite ups and downs in market share, Apple’s commitment to quality never wavered.

      <p>
        The real game-changer arrived in 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone. Combining a phone, an iPod, and an internet communicator into one device, the iPhone redefined mobile technology. Each subsequent model introduced new innovations — from the App Store ecosystem to Retina displays, Face ID, dual cameras, and powerful chips capable of desktop-level performance. The iPhone became more than a device; it became a cultural icon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside the iPhone, Apple expanded its ecosystem with the iPad, introduced in 2010, offering a new form factor for creativity, work, and entertainment. The MacBook line continued evolving, with the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro setting benchmarks for portability, power, and design. The Apple Watch, AirPods, and other devices further expanded Apple’s reach into wearables and personal technology, creating a seamless experience across all products.

        Apple’s attention to detail goes beyond hardware. Every device is supported by an ecosystem of software and services, from iOS and macOS to iCloud, Apple Music, and more. This integration allows users to move effortlessly between devices, a principle Apple calls the “continuity” experience. Each device is designed not just to work alone, but to work together, creating an environment where technology feels natural and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Apple continues to innovate, exploring advanced chips like the M1 and M2 series, improving battery life, graphics performance, and efficiency in its MacBooks and iPads. The company experiments with augmented reality, AI, and other cutting-edge technologies, keeping its devices at the forefront of the industry. With every release, Apple maintains its philosophy of blending art, engineering, and usability, inspiring millions of users and creators worldwide.
