      <h2>Apple Devices Through the Years</h2>
      <p>
        The story of Apple devices is a journey through innovation, design, and technology. It all began in 1976 with the Apple I, a computer hand-built in a garage, laying the foundation for a company that would go on to change the world. Over the decades, Apple has consistently focused on clean design, intuitive user interfaces, and pushing the boundaries of what personal technology can do.

        In 1984, the original Macintosh revolutionized personal computing with its graphical user interface and mouse, making computers accessible to everyday users. The 1990s brought the Power Macintosh series and the introduction of Mac OS, solidifying Apple’s presence in creative and professional markets.

        The real game-changer arrived in 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone. Combining a phone, an iPod, and an internet communicator into one device, the iPhone redefined mobile technology. Each subsequent model introduced new innovations — from the App Store ecosystem to Retina displays, Face ID, dual cameras, and powerful chips capable of desktop-level performance.

        Alongside the iPhone, Apple expanded its ecosystem with the iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch, and AirPods, creating a seamless experience across all products.

        Today, Apple continues to innovate, exploring advanced chips like the M1 and M2 series, improving battery life, graphics performance, and efficiency in its MacBooks and iPads. The company experiments with augmented reality, AI, and other cutting-edge technologies, keeping its devices at the forefront of the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the first Macintosh to the latest iPhone, the journey of Apple devices is one of relentless innovation, bold design, and an unwavering commitment to user experience.
